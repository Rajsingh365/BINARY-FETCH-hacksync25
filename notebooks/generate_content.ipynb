As someone who's been in the industry for over a decade, I've seen the rise of Python and its impact on the way we code.

But it was a good struggle. It forced me to understand the underlying mechanics of the language, to optimize my code, to make it efficient.

But also, it was like I was losing a part of myself, a part of my coding identity.'}, {'speaker': 'speaker2', 'text': \"That's so true.
